Cinnamon-Installer 0.4-Beta
==================

Last version release date: 26 March 2014

Author: [Lester Carballo PÃ©rez](https://github.com/lestcape)

Special thanks to:
Manjaro users and developers they have given their support to make this project possible.

A GUI Packages Manager with the ability to support all distros, where you can install Cinnamon desktop.

This is a project of GUI packages Manager tools writing in python.

The idea it's allow have an installer and uninstaller of only one package at the same time,
but with the ability to support all distros, where Cinnamon desktop can be installed.

For now are planed add support to:

   - Debian base distros using: aptdaemon(https://launchpad.net/aptdaemon/) binding and aptdaemon.client example.
   - Manjaro and Arch Linux using: python alpm bindings and pamac like example(http://git.manjaro.org/core/pamac).
   - RedHad base distro using: libsolv bindings and pysolv.asc example(https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv). Can be use also the YUM interface.
   - Gentoo using: portage code(https://github.com/gentoo/portage)

System detection:

  Ansible project https://github.com/ansible/ansible

This applet not longer has support for Arch Linux.
--------------
The comunity of Arch Linux do not want that I or other Cinnamon developer, publish about Cinnamon, and receive the users feedback (necessary on the developing any app). When the comunity of Arch Linux, want to be open to the free software world, sure that I want to support Arch Linux again...

Updater
--------------
This application come inside with another application caller Updater to allow update the main application.
